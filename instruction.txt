Sure, let's break down the steps to create a YouTube video downloader website using free tools and services:

1. **Setup Development Environment**:
   - Ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download and install it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Initialize Node.js Project**:
   - Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it using the terminal or command prompt.
   - Run `npm init -y` to initialize a new Node.js project with default settings.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install the necessary dependencies for your project. For this project, you'll need Express.js for the backend.
   - Run `npm install express` to install Express.js.

4. **Create Backend Server**:
   - Create a new file named `server.js` in your project directory.
   - Write code to set up an Express.js server in `server.js`. This server will handle requests for downloading YouTube videos.
   - Use the `ytdl-core` library to download YouTube videos. This library is a Node.js module for downloading YouTube videos and audio streams.
   - Implement a route to handle video download requests. This route will take a YouTube video URL as input and return the video file for download.

5. **Design Frontend Interface**:
   - Create an HTML file (`index.html`) to design the frontend interface of your website.
   - Add input fields for users to paste YouTube video URLs and a button to initiate the download process.
   - Style the interface using CSS to make it visually appealing.

6. **Connect Frontend and Backend**:
   - Use JavaScript to handle user input and interact with the backend server.
   - Write JavaScript code to send HTTP requests to the backend server when the user initiates a download.

7. **Deploy to GitHub**:
   - Initialize a new Git repository in your project directory (`git init`).
   - Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude node_modules and other unnecessary files from version control.
   - Add and commit your files to the Git repository (`git add .` and `git commit -m "Initial commit"`).
   - Create a new repository on GitHub and follow the instructions to push your local repository to GitHub.

8. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Sign in to your Netlify account or create a new one if you haven't already.
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify to enable continuous deployment.
   - Configure your build settings in Netlify to specify the build command (`npm run start`) and the publish directory (`public` or `dist`).
   - Deploy your site to Netlify, and Netlify will automatically build and deploy your application.

9. **Test and Iterate**:
   - Test your website to ensure that it functions as expected.
   - Iterate on your design and functionality based on user feedback or your own observations.

10. **Optional: Add Features**:
    - Explore additional features such as video format selection, progress indicators, or error handling.
    - Experiment with different design layouts or frontend frameworks to enhance the user experience.
